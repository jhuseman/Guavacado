To migrate from legacy versions of WebHost (Or Guavacado 1.X) to Guavacado 2.0, the following considerations must be made:
- `guavacado.WebHost.start_service()` no longer blocks indefinitely. Instead, it spawns a new thread for each port that is open, then returns. If your app previously relied on `guavacado.WebHost.start_service()` blocking indefinitely, you can call `guavacado.misc.wait_for_keyboardinterrupt()` to efficiently block until Ctrl+C is pressed in the terminal.
- Please note that while `guavacado.WebInterface` can still be inherited, it is now encouraged to instead instantiate it as a member variable of your class, as follows:
```python
class MyInterface(object):
	def __init__(self):
		self.host = WebHost() # note this will be automatically instantiated in WebInterface if not passed in as an argument
		self.host.add_addr()
		WebInterface(host=self.host)
		self.connect('/test/','GET_TEST','GET')
	def GET_TEST(self):
		return "Test"
```
- `guavacado.WebInterface` now requires the `__init__()` constructor to run. If your class inherits from guavacado.WebInterface, make sure that it calls `WebInterface.__init__()` in its own `__init__()` method. An example inherited implementation follows:
```python
class MyInterface(WebInterface):
	def __init__(self):
		self.host = WebHost() # note this will be automatically instantiated in WebInterface if not set here before calling __init__()
		self.host.add_addr()
		WebInterface.__init__(self)
		self.connect('/test/','GET_TEST','GET')
	def GET_TEST(self):
		return "Test"
```
- The `addr` and `port` arguments to `guavacado.WebHost`'s constructor have now been removed.  This functionality is now replaced by the  `add_addr()` method of `guavacado.WebHost`, which accepts the same optional arguments, along with an optional `TLS` argument to provide a tuple of the filenames of the certfile and keyfile for HTTPS.  While omitting the call to `add_addr()` will default to HTTP on port 80, this will result in a warning, and it is discouraged to rely on this default functionality.
