To migrate from legacy versions of WebHost (Or Guavacado 1.X) to Guavacado 2.0, the following considerations must be made:
- `guavacado.WebHost.start_service()` no longer blocks indefinitely. Instead, it spawns a new thread for each port that is open, then returns. If your app previously relied on `guavacado.WebHost.start_service()` blocking indefinitely, you can call `guavacado.wait_for_keyboardinterrupt()` to efficiently block until Ctrl+C is pressed in the terminal.
- Please note that while `guavacado.WebInterface` can still be inherited, it is now encouraged to instead instantiate it as a member variable of your class, as follows:
```python
class MyInterface(object):
	def __init__(self):
		self.host = guavacado.WebHost() # note this will be automatically instantiated in WebInterface if not passed in as an argument
		self.host.add_addr()
		self.interface = guavacado.WebInterface(host=self.host)
		self.interface.connect('/test/',self.GET_TEST,'GET')
	def GET_TEST(self):
		return "Test"
```
- `guavacado.WebInterface` now requires the `__init__()` constructor to run. If your class inherits from guavacado.WebInterface, make sure that it calls `WebInterface.__init__()` in its own `__init__()` method. An example inherited implementation follows:
```python
class MyInterface(guavacado.WebInterface):
	def __init__(self):
		self.host = guavacado.WebHost() # note this will be automatically instantiated in WebInterface if not set here before calling __init__()
		self.host.add_addr()
		guavacado.WebInterface.__init__(self)
		self.connect('/test/',self.GET_TEST,'GET')
	def GET_TEST(self):
		return "Test"
```
- The `addr` and `port` arguments to `guavacado.WebHost`'s constructor have now been removed.  This functionality is now replaced by the  `add_addr()` method of `guavacado.WebHost`, which accepts the same optional arguments, along with an optional `TLS` argument to provide a tuple of the filenames of the certfile and keyfile for HTTPS.  While omitting the call to `add_addr()` will default to HTTP on port 80, this will result in a warning, and it is discouraged to rely on this default functionality.
- Guavacado 2.0 now supports HTTPS (HTTP through TLS) and automatic redirection from HTTP to HTTPS.  An HTTPS interface can be implemented with `add_addr(port=443, TLS=('TLS_keys/certfile.crt', 'TLS_keys/keyfile.key'))` after creating a certificate and key, stored in `TLS_keys/certfile.crt` and `TLS_keys/keyfile.key`, respectively.  Self-signed keys can be generated by the script `tls_keygen.sh`, or a signed key for a public server can be obtained from a certificate authority, such as [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), that is trusted by most browsers.  When using HTTPS, you can also easily redirect HTTP traffic to the equivalent HTTPS page with `add_addr(port=80, disp_type=('redirect', 'https://domain/'))`, (with `domain` replaced with your domain name).
- `guavacado.WebHost` no longer hosts the '`static`' directory by default.  You must now manually instantiate `guavacado.WebFileInterface` to host a directory.  This allows for implementation of REST APIs without enabling direct file access when that feature is not needed.  Example "files only" implementation:
```python
host = guavacado.WebHost(loglevel='INFO')
host.add_addr(port=80, disp_type=('redirect', 'https://domain/'))
host.add_addr(port=443, TLS=('TLS_keys/certfile.crt', 'TLS_keys/keyfile.key'))
files = guavacado.WebFileInterface(host)
host.start_service()
wait_for_keyboardinterrupt()
host.stop_service()
```
